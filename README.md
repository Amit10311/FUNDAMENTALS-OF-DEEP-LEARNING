**1. The Mechanics of Deep Learning**
Explore the fundamental mechanics and tools involved in successfully training deep neural networks:

* Train your first computer vision model to learn the process of training.

* Introduce convolutional neural networks to improve accuracy of predictions in vision applications.

* Apply data augmentation to enhance a dataset and improve model generalization.



**2. Pre-trained Models and Recurrent Networks**
Leverage pre-trained models to solve deep learning challenges quickly.  Train recurrent neural networks on sequential data:

* Integrate a pre-trained image classification model to create an automatic doggy door.

* Leverage transfer learning to create a personalized doggy door that only lets in your dog.

* Train a model to autocomplete text based on New York Times headlines.



**3. Final Project: Object Classification**
Apply computer vision to create a model that distinguishes between fresh and rotten fruit.

* Create and train a model that interprets color images.

* Build a data generator to make the most out of small datasets.

* Improve training speed by combining transfer learning and feature extraction.

* Discuss advanced neural network architectures and recent areas of research where students can further improve their skills.
